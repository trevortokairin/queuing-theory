# queuing-theory
This project involves writing six classes to implement queue functionality (i.e., modeling waiting lines) in an object-oriented manner. The classes will model different types of queues, such as M/M/1, M/D/1, and M/G/1.

The goal is to gain an appreciation for object-oriented programming and understand how it differs from procedural programming. Using an object-oriented approach provides benefits like:

Maintaining state information within queue instances instead of passing parameters back and forth
Avoiding unnecessary recalculations by checking if parameters have changed
Modeling real-world entities like queues as objects
The classes created will have attributes, properties, and methods to encapsulate the queue data and operations on queues. Key capabilities will include:

Checking if a queue configuration is valid
Determining if a queue design is feasible (can support the arrival rate)
Calculating essential performance metrics like average wait times
Allowing metrics to be recalculated on demand if parameters change

Business Implications:

This project will produce reusable, modular code for modeling queues. It demonstrates a programming approach aligned with industry best practices.

The ability to accurately model queues has implications for:

Simulating waiting lines at banks, stores, call centers, etc. to improve customer experience
Analyzing manufacturing and supply chain bottlenecks
Performance testing of computer networks and web applications
Additionally, the object-oriented structure will facilitate future integration of the queuing models into larger business applications and simulations.
